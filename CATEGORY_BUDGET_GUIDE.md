│                                     │

```

- Tap **"Continue"** to save anyway (flexible!)

✅ **Success!** You'll see: "Category budgets saved successfully"

---

## 💡 Important Rules

### ✅ **What You CAN Do**

1. **Leave categories empty** - No limit for that category
2. **Set total > monthly budget** - App warns but allows it
3. **Change anytime** - Edit whenever you want
4. **Different budgets each month** - Budgets are per-month

### ❌ **What You CANNOT Do**

1. **Set individual category > monthly budget** - App blocks this
   - Example: Can't set Food = ₹60,000 if monthly = ₹50,000
2. **Set negative amounts** - Only positive numbers allowed

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **Scenario 1: Strict Budget Control**

Set budgets for ALL categories:
```
Monthly: ₹50,000
Food:    ₹12,000
Rent:    ₹20,000
Transport: ₹5,000
Entertainment: ₹6,000
Other:   ₹7,000
Total:   ₹50,000 ✅
```

### **Scenario 2: Focus on Problem Areas**

Only set budgets for categories you overspend:
```
Monthly: ₹50,000
Food:    ₹12,000  (you tend to overspend here)
Shopping: ₹8,000  (impulse buying problem)
(Other categories: empty = no limit)
```

### **Scenario 3: Flexible Approach**

Set conservative category budgets:
```
Monthly: ₹50,000
Food:    ₹10,000
Transport: ₹4,000
Total:   ₹14,000  (leaves ₹36,000 flexible)
```

## 🔔 What Happens After Setting Budgets?

### **1. When Adding Transactions**

When you add an expense:
- App checks if category has a budget
- If you exceed it, you'll see a warning
- **Transaction is NOT blocked** (just informed)

Example:
```
You're adding ₹500 to Food
Food budget: ₹12,000
Already spent: ₹11,800
⚠️ "You've exceeded your Food budget by ₹300"
```

### **2. In Budget Overview**

You'll see per-category progress:
```
Food        ₹13,200 / ₹12,000  🔴 (Over)
Transport   ₹3,200 / ₹5,000    🟢 (Good)
Rent        ₹20,000 / ₹20,000  🟠 (At limit)
```

### **3. In Reports & Analytics**

- Compare planned vs actual spending
- Identify overspending patterns
- Adjust budgets for next month

## 🛠️ Tips & Best Practices

### **Tip 1: Start Simple**

Don't set budgets for all categories at once:
1. First month: Set budgets for 2-3 problem categories
2. Track for a month
3. Gradually add more categories

### **Tip 2: Be Realistic**

Look at your past spending:
1. Check last month's expenses
2. Set budgets based on actual patterns
3. Add 10-20% buffer for unexpected costs

### **Tip 3: Review Monthly**

At the end of each month:
1. Check which categories you exceeded
2. Adjust budgets for next month
3. Celebrate categories where you stayed under!

### **Tip 4: Use Empty Fields**

Don't force yourself to budget everything:
- Essential categories (Food, Rent) → Set budgets
- Variable categories (Entertainment) → Maybe set budgets
- Irregular expenses (Health) → Leave empty
